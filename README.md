# ReactJs-Course
this git repository is not one for my own projects in React. It just _records_ my evolution throughout the book : [Fullstack React: The Complete Guide to ReactJS and friends](https://www.amazon.fr/Fullstack-React-Complete-Reactjs-Friends/dp/0991344626)

This book provides simple mini-projects for the reader to ensure the clarity of example and explanations.
I will be recreating those mini-projects all alone from scratch after completeing the explanations in the book.

> **Learning by doing** is ***THE*** way to mastery.

### Mini-projects and what I've learned in them
|Project folder name |What I've learned|
|---|---|
|Product&nbsp;Voting&nbsp;App|transpiling js to the browser with babel, discovered the component system of React, the notion of states in react components and how to update (set) states while also treating them as immutable|
|Time Tracking App|Breaking a complex app into simple reusable components, determine what components should be stateful, inverse data-flow, create a RESTful api, add server communication|
