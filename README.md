# ReactJs-Course
this git repository is not one for my projects in ReactJs. It just _records_ my evolution throughout the book : [Fullstack React: The Complete Guide to ReactJS and friends](https://www.amazon.fr/Fullstack-React-Complete-Reactjs-Friends/dp/0991344626)

This book provides simple mini-projects for the reader to ensure the clarity of example and explanations.
I will be recreating those mini-projects all alone from scratch after following the explanations in the book.

> **Learning by doing** is ***THE*** way to mastery.
